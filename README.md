## Project Overview
Creating a Python-based task to calculate carbon savings when switching from diesel cars to hydrogen
cars would involve both front-end and back-end programming. Below is a simplified outline of how you
can structure this task.

## Features
-  A form to collect information from the client.
-  A button to submit the form for calculation.
-  Implement client-side validation to ensure that users enter valid data.
-  Provide feedback to the user while processing the calculation, e.g., a loading spinner or progress bar.
-  Display the carbon saving potential in a clear and understandable format e.g : kg.
-  Implement the carbon saving calculation logic based on the provided data
-  Create API endpoints to handle the form submission and return the results as JSON data.
-  Verify that the input data is in the expected format and within reasonable ranges
-  Format the calculation results as JSON and send them back to the front end.
-  Implement error handling to gracefully manage exceptions or invalid inputs.

## Prerequisites
- Python (3.10 or higher)
- Django (3.0 or higher)
- Django Rest Framework
- Git
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository:
- git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git



 ### Create a virtual environment (recommended):
- python -m venv venv


## Install dependencies:
- pip install -r requirements.txt


## Run migrations:
- python manage.py migrate


 ## Start the development server
 - python manage.py runserver
 



## Usage
Form is used from the Client side to collect data sources like emission factors for diesel and hydrogen vehicles to calculate CO2
emissions. The formula could be something like: ùê∂arbon ùëÜavings = (Emission from Diesel ‚àí Emission from Hydrogen) ‚àó ùê¥nnual ùëÄilage

## Technologies Used
- Django
-  HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- django rest framework
- django

## Contributing
This project is open for improvement which includes the addition of authentication system and historical tracking of carbon
savings
