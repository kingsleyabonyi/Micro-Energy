## Project Overview
Creating a Python-based task to calculate carbon savings when switching from diesel cars to hydrogen
cars would involve both front-end and back-end programming. Below is a simplified outline of how you
can structure this task.

## Features
-  A form to collect information from the client.
-  A button to submit the form for calculation.
-  Implement client-side validation to ensure that users enter valid data.
-  Provide feedback to the user while processing the calculation, e.g., a loading spinner or progress bar.
-  Display the carbon saving potential in a clear and understandable format e.g : kg.
-  Implement the carbon saving calculation logic based on the provided data
-  Create API endpoints to handle the form submission and return the results as JSON data.
-  Verify that the input data is in the expected format and within reasonable ranges
-  Format the calculation results as JSON and send them back to the front end.
-  Implement error handling to gracefully manage exceptions or invalid inputs.
